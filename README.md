# RStudio_Plot_Labels_Placer
A method for creating plots in R where the point labels are at user-specified positions. In particular, avoid overlapping text labels

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate an easy way to ensure that labels on R plots do not overlap, are visually appealing, and conform to user-specified selections. The only R package required is the "manipulate" package.
